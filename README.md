2) Go to ReColorLib Library.
3) Run: `python run_examples.py` and check `Examples_Check` folder to see example results.

### All the operationns in the library are based on the paper - [An Adaptive Fuzzy-Based System to Simulate, Quantify and Compensate Color Blindness.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10662.pdf)
